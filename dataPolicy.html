               Explain the functioning of the custom domain feature.
            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               Custom domain refers to the practice of using a personalized web address (URL) for a business website,
               rather than a generic one provided by a hosting platform. It works by associating a unique domain name
               with the business website's content, allowing visitors to access the site through this custom address.
            </p>
            <p class="data-text">
               For instance, instead of using "businessname.hostingplatform.com" as the website address, a business can
               opt for a custom domain like "businessname.com." By setting up this custom domain and linking it to the
               website, when potential customers enter "businessname.com" in their web browser, they will be directed to
               the business's website, creating a more professional and brand-oriented online presence. This not only
               enhances the business's credibility but also ensures a memorable and distinct online identity.

               Gmail or Getsend?
            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               Indeed, Getsend offers better security than Gmail. With Getsend Mail, only you can access your emails;
               not even Getsend itself can read them. In contrast, Gmail keeps decryption keys on its servers, enabling
               them to read your messages or share them with authorities if needed. This absence of zero-access
               encryption in Gmail increases the vulnerability of your data during a potential breach. Getsend mail,
               however, uses zero-access encryption for storing messages, adding an additional safeguard against data
               breaches.

               How We Utilize Collected Data:
            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               <strong>IP Address - </strong> There's a single exception. Generally, we don't maintain logs or retain
               data, in line with
               Nigeria's protective laws. An exception arises during hacking or DDOS attacks when we anonymously record
               IP addresses, but only for up to 10 days. By default, we don't retain user details like message IDs,
               sender and recipient addresses, subjects, browser versions, countries, or timestamps.

            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               <strong>Cryptocurrency Payment Address - </strong> We retain cryptocurrency addresses for specific
               circumstances, such as
               refunds or providing bonus payments to users.

            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               <strong>Card Details - </strong> For card payments, our payment gateway, Flutterwave, handles all
               transactions, with no
               data stored on our end. We can process actions like refunds, paybacks, and withdrawals, but we don't
               directly store this information.

            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               <strong>Communication with Support - </strong> We use this information for internal purposes, including
               setting up
               features, considering customer suggestions, addressing bug reports, managing account upgrades, and
               tracking status.

            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               <strong>User Email Address - </strong> We keep customer email records to send updates, inform about
               latest features, and

            </p>

               In Nigeria, on June 14, 2023, President Bola Tinubu enacted the Data Protection Act, 2023. This law's
               primary goal is safeguarding the essential rights, freedoms, and interests of data subjects, as
               stipulated in Nigeria's 1999 Constitution.

               It's vital to emphasize that we are not engaged in any private or governmental surveillance or monitoring

               Please note that we will only share limited user information if legally mandated by Nigerian authorities.
               We adhere to Nigerian law when addressing electronic notices. Typically, we question requests, especially
               those that appear questionable or run counter to public interest. We refrain from compliance until all
               legal avenues are exhausted.
            </p>

            <p class="data-text">
               According to Nigerian law, authorities, not us, must inform individuals involved in legal proceedings. We
